## Google Code-in

Google Code-in is a contest sponsored by Google to encourage pre-university students to know about open-source Projects and helps them contribute actively in such Projects.

This year, the contest started on 28 November 2016, and will go on till 16 January 2017. Preparation of this world-wide contest started much sooner. Around 10 October it was announced, and from 24 October, preparation started.

## Day 1

Well, my bad I forgot to register and it was only today, that I registered. This is my first time in GCI. But, I have checked previous year archives. Today, when the registration process ended, I rushed towards task list and there FOSSASIA and KDE were the only two organisations that I recognise. So, I claimed the task from FOSSASIA, it was about deploying Event Webapp on Heroku. I've already used Heroku once and so I've already registered on Heroku. So, went ahead and forked the FOSSASIA Event Webapp repository on Github and I cloned it on my laptop. The deployment was easy. Then I deployed and Submitted the task for review. It's now waiting for approval of Parental Consent. It was really a lot of fun doing the task. It felt like a responsibility on me and I did it very responsibly.
