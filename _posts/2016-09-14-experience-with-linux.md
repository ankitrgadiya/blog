title: My exprience with Linux
description: A journey of starting to use Linux and getting familiar with it.
---
Over two months passed since my last post. And this time too I'll promise myself to update this blog ASAP.

After around 10 months with Linux, I'm more comfortable with it. Over this time, I've tried different distros varing from very stable ones to rolling release ones. In this post I'm going to talk about few of them.
## [Debian](https://www.debian.org)

<br />
Over this period the distro that I've used the most is Debian. Its really good and very stable. Debian makes a good distro for servers. I've even used Debian cloud server for a while, and I'm using Debian on my home server everyday. This is also a light-weight distro, which will use less resources, so I'll do fine on Netbooks or Old computers. My most favorite part is **apt**. Debian is one of the old distros which is being developed since 1993 and its development is not going to stop anytime soon. Also Debian project supports any given specific version for atleast 2-3 years. Thats the reason why a lot of distros use Debian as its base. Even Ubuntu is using Debian as its base.

## [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org)

<br />
As I've mentioned in one of my previous posts, Arch Linux is commonly known as a distro for power users/ more experienced users. I'm not very experienced in Linux but still I've used Arch Linux for around half a month. For those who really are professionals and want to customize there machine fully to satisfy there needs then Arch Linux gives a good oportunity for that right from the installation. Also its one for the few distros which provides packages directly from the upstream so you always get the bleeding edge techology. But unfortunately it was not for me at this point of time.

## [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)

<br />
Manjaro is based on Arch Linux, but it comes preconfigured to a greater extent, which makes it a very good distro for new users or users who wants to switch to Arch Linux but don't wanna go through all that long process of installation and configuring the system. Although Manjaro maintains its own repositories, still as an Arch user you get access to AUR. Manjaro comes in different flavours, namely XFCE, KDE, Gnome, i3, JWM, BSPWM, et cetera. But it is not my cup of tea.

## [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
<br />
Fedora is backed by Rat Hat Linux. I installed it for the first time as dual-boot on my ThinkPad around 1 and a half month ago and since then, I'm loving the experience. Also as Fedora uses Gnome desktop as default DE, so I naturally loved it. Also Fedora repositories constantly updates the packages and always use the latest technology. I'm still exploring Fedora so not much to say.

## My current setup

<br />
I'm currently using Debian 8.5 Jessie on my home server-cum-desktop. And my laptop is currently dual-booting Windows with Fedora. Its pretty much satisfying my needs currently and I think I'm gonna stick with it for a while now. Finally that time has come when I stopped switch distros. Still, I'm constantly trying new distros in Virtualbox.
