title: GNOME Asia Summit 2016 Part II
---

Writing this a little late, as I stayed few more days in Delhi.

It was very interesting and exciting. This was first event of its kind for me and it was great learning experience.

> If you're the most intelligent person in the room then you're in the wrong room.

That's why I choose a room filled with Linux Enthusiasts, developers, and professionals to place myself in.

This whole event was divided in 3 days.

<br />

## Day 0
<br />
I arrived a little late but the event was still not started. So, I got an ID card with schedule for the day and volunteers directed me to the hall. I was kinda uncomfortable at first as didn't know anybody. **Ekaterina** started the event's first workshop. It was about **How to make first contribution**. Then we had a little break, that's when I started talking to few guys. I was getting more comfortable, people were very kind and welcoming. This was followed by workshop by **David King** on **Writing a Gnome application for newcomers**. At last the **Arun** and **Nirbheek** took over with the workshop on **Gstreamer**.

## Day 1
<br />
The event started in a big Auditorium this time with **Cosimo** talking about **Next billion Users**. Then we moved to a different building nearby for further talks. **Pravin Satpute** took over the stage talking about **State of Indian Language in Gnome 3.20** followed by **Ankit Prateek** talking about **Privacy and Security in the age of Surveillance**. Then I attended **Tobias Mueller**'s talk about **Functionality, Security, Usability : Choose any two or Gnome**. Then during lunch I talked with few more people.This was followed by few more lightning talks and yet another day ended.

## Day 2
<br />
Starting with **Ekaterina**'s speech, followed by a short animated film made completely using free software by **Arteom** and **Jehan**. This was followed by few talks. Later during lunch, while talk to my new friends I came to know about GSoC and I discuss about it with others too. More lightning talks were held. Finally we posed for group photos and various other funny photos. Finally I went home with a great memory of these 3 days.
