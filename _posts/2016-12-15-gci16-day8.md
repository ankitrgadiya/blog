## Task 9

<br />
"Website: Identify and Fix Issues our PSLab site on Github Pages". But the problem was [PSLab Site](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.com) was way too simple and was using Clean Blog template so it was hard to find issues in it. So, I went ahead to check Site and what I found was that the site was broken or its not rendering properly. So, I reported the [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/issues/10) and someone fixed it by using CDN links insteas. Open Source :P. But, then I found out that [developers.html](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/issues/14), the second file was not fixed. So, I went ahead and fixed it and then I reported the [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/issues/14) and immediately created [PR](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/pull/15). Also in the meanwhile I found out that site was not having a Favicon(image placed on Tab, which generally is Logo or part of Logo). So, I created one more [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/issues/13) and this time I mentioned that I'm working on it. Then I created a Logo for PSLab, also I though about using FOSSASIA "F" logo as used in other sites of FOSSASIA to use as Favicon. Also, I googled and found out Font Awesome's Flask Icon. I commented on the issue, suggested three options and asked others to choose one. It took a while but most people prefer Flask Icon, so I went ahead and added Flask icon and updated existing [PR](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab.fossasia.org/pull/15). But, after a while no one commented or merged it and so I asked in Slack and so [@hemantjadon](https://github.com/hemantjadon) merged it and this marks the ending of this task.

## Task 10

<br />
Task was "FOSSASIA: Do a mini-project, solve an issue, add a feature, fix a bug, improve design, add tests" and I recently gave a new look to FOSSASIA [GCI 16 Site](https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org). So, I asked [@princu7](https://github.com/princu7) that can I use New look PR in this task and he gave an affirmative reply, so I used this and that's how I finished 10 tasks.
