## Task 6

So, after Task 5 I was like Why not try a task which is completely new to me and hence, Task 6 "
loklak search: Deploy the website of loklak search on your own GitHub account". A completely new and exciting thing to me. But very less information was there in both task and [loklak search](https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search) README.md. So, that means I have to do all the research. But I call it a day. I woke up and all I was thinking was about loklak search. I asked in Slack and after some googling I got to a result, I was about deploying angularjs apps on Github which involve use of [Bower components](https://bower.io/). I did everything and I got an empty site. Guess what?? It was wrong so I asked again in Slack and this time a loklak search project contributor was present he pointed me out to [Angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#angular-cli) README. I read it and did all the things and I was still getting an empty site. I asked again and he helped me overcome a small issue and BOOM!!, I deployed my version of search engine. Unbelievable, isn't it? And That's how one more exciting task finished.

## Task 7

Due to less documentation in last task, I reported an [Issue](https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search/issues/119) in upstream repository and guess what they created [Task] out of it. Yes, I know FOSSASIA is awesome. So, I decided to claim that task and I added Requirement and How to deploy? section and updated already existing Installation section and created a [PR](https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search/pull/122) and it was merged in no time.

While awaiting approval I Fixed 2 of the issues in FOSSASIA [GCI 16 Site](https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org).

* Photo not showing due to misspell in students.yml file. Here's a link to [PR](https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org/pull/384).
* Map section was making it hard to scroll. I added margins around it and created [PR](https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org/pull/394).
